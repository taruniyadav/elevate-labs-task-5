# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📚 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of two columns:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

*Note: Dummy data was generated for illustration purposes.*

## 📋 Project Objectives
- Perform basic EDA to understand the dataset structure.
- Visualize the data using histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables.
- Document observations for each visual.
- Summarize overall findings based on analysis.

## 📈 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and checked dataset info using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()`.
2. Conducted univariate analysis through histograms and boxplots.
3. Conducted bivariate analysis through scatterplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps.
4. Wrote observations after each visualization.
5. Provided final summary and insights.

## 📝 Summary of Findings
- The data is clean with no missing values.
- The survival rate is lower than the non-survival rate.
- Passenger ID has no meaningful relationship with survival outcome.
- No strong correlations were observed between available features.

## 🗂 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`EDA_Project.ipynb`)
- PDF Report (`EDA_Report.pdf`)
